## Motivation
The main motivation was to become a command line ninja! that's why i got rid of the Unity on my Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and customized my own windows from scratch! don't worry if you want to do the same, i will be uploading all my daily tweakings to this repo and all the dependancies.

## Dependancies
There are whole lot of dependancies to all of this... i will be uploading it on daily basis... i am too sleepy right now... i should probably stop typing... STOP!!!
Ok Good night!
